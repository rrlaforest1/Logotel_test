## Development

From the beginning it was very clear that I would need to implement classes and OOP to better organise and manage all the different components and characters of the game. Along with a set of data files to support the incoming waves of monsers, cat types and levels.

## Style

For the style I choose a very simple (one might say too simple) aesthetic of black and white with some touches of coulour here and there but given the simplicity I try for the first time to make my own sprites and animate them with CSS to add a little pizzazz to the otherwise dull game. Also no game is finished with a little bit of sound; the best of what the free internet can offer I assure you.
